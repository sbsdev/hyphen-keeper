* Hyphen Keeper

A small web app to keep a whitelist of approved hyphenation patterns.

This web app will let you maintain a list of words and their approved
hyphenation patterns. In the background it will generate hyphenation
pattern files to be used with [[https://github.com/hunspell/hyphen][libhyphen]].
